## Current Work Focus
**Project Initialization Phase**
- Setting up project structure and foundation
- Creating Next.js application with TypeScript
- Implementing multilingual support with i18next
- Setting up component libraries (Shadcn UI, Radix UI, Material UI)

## Recent Changes
- Created Memory Bank structure for project documentation
- Documented project requirements and technical specifications
- Defined architecture patterns and technology stack

## Next Steps (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Project Setup (Current)
1. **Initialize Next.js Project**
   - Create Next.js 14 app with App Router
   - Configure TypeScript
   - Set up Tailwind CSS
   - Install and configure component libraries

2. **Setup Development Environment**
   - Configure ESLint and Prettier
   - Set up internationalization structure
   - Create basic project folder structure
   - Configure environment variables

3. **Basic Layout Components**
   - Create root layout with language routing
   - Implement Header component with navigation
   - Create Footer component
   - Set up basic responsive structure

### Phase 2: Core Pages (Next)
1. **Hero Section Implementation**
   - Create animated "We Buy & Sell Machinery" design
   - Implement responsive layout
   - Add multilingual text support

2. **CTA Section**
   - Design call-to-action buttons
   - Create contact form integration
   - Add "Get in Touch" and "View Listings" actions

3. **Services Section**
   - Explain buying process for Japanese customers
   - Detail selling process for international buyers
   - Create informative content blocks

### Phase 3: Functionality (Future)
1. **Contact Integration**
   - Backend API for contact forms
   - Email notification system
   - Form validation and error handling

2. **Admin System**
   - Authentication for listing management
   - CRUD operations for machinery listings
   - Basic admin dashboard

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Language Implementation
- **Decision**: Use route-based internationalization (`/en/`, `/ja/`)
- **Rationale**: Better SEO, cleaner URLs, easier maintenance
- **Status**: Ready to implement

### Component Library Strategy
- **Decision**: Shadcn UI as primary, Radix UI for complex components
- **Rationale**: Consistent design system, high accessibility
- **Status**: Ready to implement

### Database Choice
- **Decision**: MongoDB for initial implementation
- **Rationale**: Flexible schema for machinery data, easier setup
- **Status**: Pending implementation

## Current Challenges
1. **Design System Integration**: Ensuring all three component libraries work harmoniously
2. **Performance Optimization**: Balancing multiple component libraries with performance
3. **SEO for Multiple Languages**: Implementing proper meta tags and sitemaps
4. **Content Strategy**: Creating compelling content for both buyer and seller audiences

## Resources Needed
- Company branding materials (logo, colors, fonts)
- Sample machinery data for testing
- Email configuration for contact forms
- Domain and hosting decisions

## Success Metrics for Current Phase
- Next.js application running locally
- Basic responsive layout working
- Language switching functional
- Component system integrated
- Development environment fully configured
